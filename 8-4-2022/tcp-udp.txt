tcp - establish connection between server and client before data communication
    - slow
    - service reliable
        -in case of data lose provides automatic re-transmittion
        - supports acknowledgement
    - data gurantee
    - 20-60 bytes
    - supports byte straming data transfer
    - no broadcast
    - supports extensive error checking
    - sequencing of data
    - uses 3 way hand shaking for connection establishment
      for connection closing uses 4 way hand shaking

udp - no connection established
    - faster
    - not reliable
        - no re-transmittion
        - no acknowledgement
    - no data gurantee
    - 8 bytes
    - does not supports byte straming data transfer
    - broadcasting
    - does not supports extensive error checking
    - no sequencing of data
    - no support for hand shaking


3 way handshake:
