AF_INET -> address format internet protocol



packet_socket = socket(PF_PACKET, type, htons(ETH_P_ALL));
PF_PACKET family used for sending raw data to the application.
type could be raw of sock_dgram.
    sock_raw packet includes link layer header
    dgram packet 
at physical link layer a standard packet structure followed based on ethernet



PF_PACKET sends a packet interface at device level. PF_PACKETS are used for recieving raw data directly to the application user.

struct sockadd_ll; (link layer) physical link layer protocol.

struct

while recieving packet is passing to link layer and stored in a structure called link layer.


setsockopt(int socket_id, int level, int optname, const void *optcal, socklen_t optlen);

a request from socket level, a request from transport level, a request from network level.

->add this code before binding in the server code if you want port to be reused.
--> if(setsockopt(server_fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR | SO_REUSEPORT, &opt, sizeof(opt))){
    perror("setsocket);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
