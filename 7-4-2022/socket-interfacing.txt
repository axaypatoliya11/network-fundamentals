socket: socket represent end point , end link or end address in a network communication programming. 

there are many n/w communication protocols supported by sockets. we can say that these socket systems are designed to support all the n/w communication protocols. because of the same reason socket system calls and their parameters are appeares to be generic in nature. 

socket system call takes parameters such as socket structure and size(that represents the socket address size).

each and every socket has 5 parameters.
1) protocol communication
2) IP address of the source(server)
3) IP address of destination(client)
4) port number of source
5) port number of destination


any network application program ends with client and server model.

bind() system call binds the server socket with well known server and IP address. at this point server is said to be half binded. after bind server has to listen

listen(): how many server are waiting for connection

accept():


#include<sys/types.h>
#include<sys/socket.h>
int socket(int family, int flag, int protocol);
family: it will tell what type of a network protocol we want to use.
AF_INET: address format internet

flag: Sock_stream: connection oriented, connection less oriented

in the IP header protocoal value is 0(zero).

on successful execution socket call returns socket file descreptor(socdes).

int bind(int socfd, struct socaddr *addr, int addr_length);
structu soc_address{
    sockeaddress_family;
    socetaddress_data;

}

connect() system call is used by clinet program to initiate communication with server.
